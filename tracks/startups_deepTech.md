### KEYNOTE: MAKE SOMETHING PEOPLE NEED
[<img src="http://daho.am/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/static1.squarespace.jpg" width="48"> Kevin Adler](http://daho.am/speaker/kevin-adler/) - Founder @ Miracle Messages

The question is not what you build, but why you build it, and for whom. Or even better: why are you here? In his inspiring and deeply personal keynote talk, social entrepreneur and sociologist Kevin F. Adler shares some of the questions that have changed his life, shaping his journey from a small town to the University of Cambridge to Silicon Valley, and from EdTech to Miracle Messages, the world-renown nonprofit he founded in December 2014 to end homelessness by rebuilding social support systems, with smart phones, social media, and volunteers.
