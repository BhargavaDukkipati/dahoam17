### THAT TRUMP MOMENT - WHEN TRAFFIC HITS YOU HARD AND WHAT TO LEARN FROM IT
[<img src="http://daho.am/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/kaiser-marco-blau-937x937.jpg" width="48"> Marco Kaiser](http://daho.am/speaker/marco-kaiser/) - ZEIT ONLINE

In November 2016, the unexpected happened - Donald Trump was elected next president of the United States. When the news broke on early morning of November 9th, traffic to news sites all over the world exploded. It hit ZEIT ONLINE at an as before unseen rate and brought the site down. Hear about what happened, why it happened, and what Marco and his team learned from it - and what they did and do to prevent this from happening again.

### CREATE ANALYTICS â€“ MEDIA MEETS DATA
[<img src="http://daho.am/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/aninna.png" width="48"> Annina Neumann](http://daho.am/speaker/annina-neumann/) - Head of Data Sciences at ProSiebenSat.1

In the media industry, we can find a surprisingly large range of data analytics puzzles. Whether the challenge is content mining with audio/video recognition, data-driven Adressable TV or algorithmically optimizing TV schedules â€“ there is a lot to discover for data engineers, data scientists and developers alike. But how do these analytical and technical solutions bring benefit to such historically creative area as TV, entertainment or online dating? Can the success of a video really be captured by machine learning? Can the emotion it elicits be predicted by a mathematical formula? In this talk I will give an overview of data driven development projects focusing on analyzing and utilizing video content. I will tap into machine learning methods applied, developmental approaches and lessons learned.

ðŸ¤– Software Engineer @ Facebook


Facebook is more than just a web site, it's a complex dynamic application used by more than 1.8 billion people worldwide. It takes scalable and reliable infrastructure to allow Facebook to run smoothly on thousands of servers. This talk will share an insider's view at the challenges and solutions used by Infrastructure teams at Facebook in order to build and maintain core systems and services powering the site.

### HOW GITHUB USES GITHUB TO BUILD AND DEPLOY GITHUB
Arthur Schreiber, Application Engineer @ GitHub
Lilli Seyther-Besecke, Account Manager @ GitHub

This talk shares an inside view of how the globally distributed teams at GitHub use the platform to develop GitHub. It demonstrates the cross-team collaboration of engineering, sales, marketing, services as well as legal by highlighting the success criteria that enable GitHub to deploy more than 500 times a week.

### INTRO TO KUBERNETES - RETHINK SCALABLE INFRASTRUCTURE WITH CONTAINERS
Max Leonard Inden - Engineer @ CoreOS

Distributing and deploying software inside (Docker-) containers for security, isolation and ease of use is the new big thing. But once you got all your services nicely wrapped - who takes care of all these containers? Kubernetes, originating from Google, helps you manage containerized applications, as the operating system of your datacenter, treating hundreds of machines as a single resource pool. This talk introduces the core concepts of Kubernetes, its benefits and its huge ecosystem and gives you an idea of how Google controls parts of their gigantic infrastructure.

### TIMELION: TIME SERIES PROCESSING AND VISUALIZATION IN KIBANA
Sylvain Wallez - Elastic

Kibana is the well known analytics and dashboarding tool in the Elastic Stack. A lesser known part of it is Timelion, dedicated to time series analysis and visualization. It allows to not only display time series, but also process and combine them with a dedicated expression language. After a quick overview of the recent additions to Kibana, we will explore the various features of Timelion and its powerful language. We'll discover how having dedicated features for the time dimension and using the new pipeline aggregations in Elasticsearch brings a lot of additional insight compared to more traditional visualizations.

### TURN THE SHIP AROUND: ADVENTURES OF ONE DATA TEAM
Sergii Khomenko - Stylight

Data is the new bacon or Data is the new soil. Yet, itâ€™s still hard to get data processing right without spending too many resources, yet keeping it flexible enough. From another side, by centralizing data expertise in one place, so called BI itâ€™s easy to hit a bottleneck. In this talk, we will walk you through our transformation from centralized BI team to decentralized product-based Data Platform while discussing technical decisions and reasons behind them. From monolithic to completely serverless and back to a balanced hybrid architecture. The talk gives insights into our experience with many AWS services, that from the first look might look helpful, but still have the price to pay.

### PICASSO'S TERMINAL; MACHINE LEARNING FOR ART AND CREATIVITY
Gene Kogan

Over the past several years, two trends in machine learning have converged to pique the curiosity of artists working with code: the proliferation of powerful open source deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and Torch, and the emergence of data-intensive generative models for hallucinating images, sounds, and text as though they came from the oeuvre of Shakespeare, Picasso, or a gigantic database of digitized cats. This talk will review these developments and offer a set of interdisciplinary tools and learning resources for artists and data scientists alike, as well as present a series of live interactive demos enabling artists and musicians to use machine learning in real-time.
