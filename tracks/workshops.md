We have long understood that to build brilliant products we need to start from the user. If we find a concrete user need and can provide a good solution for it - commercial success will follow. The same is true for innovation. Disruptive innovations begin with a team that has trust, focus and the ability to move fast. To create teams like that you have to start with the people. The questions are the same - what do the users of the organisation (= the teams) need to be successful? Do we have a good solution for it? If we create that environment commercial success can follow.

Let's start with finding and solving one issue that is keeping your team from disrupting the world with #robotics, #mobility or #A.I.
