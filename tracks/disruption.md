### DESIGNING THE FUTURE — HOW 3D PRINTING IS TRANSFORMING MANUFACTURING

[<img src="http://daho.am/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Untitled-2.png" width="48"> Lin Kayser](http://daho.am/speaker/lin-kayser/) - Founder @ Hyperganic

How would we design things if complexity came for free? Additive manufacturing technologies are changing how we think about the design, construction, and production of almost all the objects around us. Lin will share his personal story how he got involved with 3D printing half a decade ago, what he thinks the future has in store for us, now that the technologies are increasingly being used in the production of end-use parts, and how his company, Hyperganic, is helping drive this change.

### RESPOND TO THE DEMAND TO ACCESS SPACE IN A DISRUPTIVE AND SUSTAINABLE WAY.

[<img src="http://daho.am/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/1d162c6.jpg" width="48"> Guillaume Girard](http://daho.am/speaker/guillaume-girard/) - Founder @ Zero 2 Infinity

The upsurge in the performance of small-satellites has set the conditions for a disruption in the Space industry. With better performance and lower costs, small-satellites will open Space to a wider range of institutions, empowering them to provide better solutions for our knowledge-based societies and Internet of Things. OneWeb, Boeing, SpaceX, Samsung, etc. are all coming up with mega satellite constellations for global-web access, with more than 10,000 small-satellites together. For this to occur, the fundamental tool that will allow small-satellites to be deployed in Space doesn’t exist yet and the market thus craves for a dedicated small-satellite launcher. With the launcher Bloostar, we are simplifying access to Space to serve it an efficient, affordable and sustainable way. By means of a hybrid Balloon-Rocket solution (a “Rockoon”), Bloostar uses a stratospheric balloon as the initial ascent stage followed by three rocket stages to reach orbit. The balloon stage, released from open seas on board a standard ship, eliminates the need for a launch facility and delivers the rocket stage to a near-space environment which enables significant advantages. Bloostar elevates above the atmosphere to start its rockets in a quasi-vacuum environment. It becomes an elegant and efficient solution to response in an affordable way the emergence of the new Space Internet, Observation, Security, and Science.

### TOWARDS THE ROBOTIC ASSISTANT FOR EVERYONE

Approaching Asimov's 1st law "A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm." has been the underlying paradigm for ground breaking technologies that enable robots to work among humans. A short trip through the methods in safe physical human-robot interaction, intuitive usability and collective learning that will democratize automation technologies.

### WHAT IS A.I.?

[<img src="http://daho.am/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/hesam_rabeti.jpg" width="48"> Hesam Rabeti](http://daho.am/speaker/hesam-rabeti/) - Machine Perception @ TUM CVPR

In his talk “What is AI?”, Hesam will shed light on the broad field of Artificial Intelligence. He will give a simple explanation of some of the underlying concepts and methods used to solve particular problems in AI. He will then dive deeper into the specific field of 3D reconstruction. At the end, he will demo the real-time 3D reconstruction capabilities of the Google Tango enabled Lenovo Phab 2 Pro.

### DESIGNING AND BUILDING THE FUTURE OF TRANSPORTATION

[<img src="http://daho.am/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/mariana.png" width="48"> Mariana Avezum](http://daho.am/speaker/mariana-avezum/) - Project Lead @ WARR Hyperloop

Hyperloop is a high-speed transportation concept proposed by Elon Musk in 2013. It envisions transportation capsules levitating inside a low-pressure tube close to the speed of sound. By drastically reducing aerodynamic drag in the aforementioned evacuated tube and reducing surface friction by i.e. magnetic levitation or air-bearings, the concept becomes technically feasible. To foster interest and innovation, SpaceX has organized an international student competition to test sub-scale versions of Hyperloop vehicles on a one mile purpouse-build tube in Hawthorne, California. The "WARR Hyperloop" student team from the TU Munich successfully demonstrated their prototype in the competition with over 700 entries and 30 finalists, and secured the grand prize for the "fastest pod" in the end. The design and build process will be reviewed in hindsight of the unique challenges posed by the Hyperloop concept and the competition constrains, before eventually taking a look back at the competition week, the final run and concluding why "wheels are pretty good”.

### RETHINKING TECH EDUCATION

[<img src="http://daho.am/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/thomas-bachem-2138x3209-e1495528309331.jpg" width="48"> Thomas Bachem](http://daho.am/speaker/thomas-bachem/) - Founder @ CODE.Berlin

Higher education needs an update. Most universities are stuck with traditional lecture-based, linear and grade-oriented ways of learning, despite the fact that educational concepts like challenge-based, competency-based and project-based learning, flipped classroom, mastery learning and P2P learning are proven to be better ways to learn for human brains. We want to show how these can be implemented to create a superior learning experience for everyone. That’s why we’re currently building CODE, a private state-recognized University of Applied Sciences in Berlin that will be unlike any other university.

### SOCIAL IMPACT OF AUTONOMOUS INTELLIGENT MACHINES AND POSSIBLE SCENARIOS FOR THE FUTURE OF SOCIETY

Intelligent automation and digitalization are changing whole industries at a never seen pace. This has vast implications for society and public interest. Furthermore, this has implications for the labour market that are already starting to show. Many Jobs will become obsolete and the workforce of tomorrow will face different skill requirements than today. The Global Shapers Munich under the patronage of the world economic forum are building a coding school for kids from a weaker socioeconomic background with difficult access to tech and tech education to prepare them for the labour market of tomorrow. However, the question what our society should look like in the digital age remains unanswered. It’s a question we need to ask to enable everybody to be part of society and maintain civil order.
